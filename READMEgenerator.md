The purpose of this assignment was to dynamically create a professional README.md for a user's project. It uses JavaScript, node and npm inquirer to prompt a user for important details pertaining to their project - title, description, licenses, contributing, tests, links to view the deployed version, contact information, etc. Once the information has been entered by the user, the README is created with and said information is displayed on the page in a clean, professional manner. Script pages have been separated and then exported/imported to their appropriate places so that the application is easy to dissect for any other person that may be debugging/working on it.
